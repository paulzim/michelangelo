# Michelangelo User Guides

This guide provides you step by step how to build, train, and deploy machine learning models at scale using Michelangelo's unified ML platform.

## **Getting Started: Your First ML Workflow**

New to Michelangelo? Follow this step-by-step path to build your first end-to-end ML pipeline:

### **1. Understand ML Pipelines (Start Here)**
Before diving into specific tasks, understand how Michelangelo orchestrates ML workflows:
* [**ML Pipelines Overview**](./ml-pipelines/index.md) - Learn about tasks, workflows, and pipelines
* [**Getting Started with Pipelines**](./ml-pipelines/getting-started.md) - Build your first pipeline in 30 minutes

### **2. Prepare Your Data**
Get your data ready for training:
* [**Prepare Your Data**](./prepare-your-data.md) - Load, clean, and split datasets using Ray and Spark

### **3. Train Your Model**
Develop and train your ML model:
* [**Train and Register a Model**](./train-and-register-a-model.md) - Train locally or at scale with distributed computing

### **4. Manage Your Models**
Version and organize trained models:
* [**Model Registry Guide**](./model-registry-guide.md) - Version, track, and manage trained models

### **5. Deploy Your Model**
Serve predictions in production:
* [**Deploy a Model**](./deploy-a-model.md) - Bind a registered model to an inference server and validate predictions

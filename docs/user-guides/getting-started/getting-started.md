# Getting Started with ML Pipelines

Build and run your first ML pipeline on Michelangelo AI in minutes. This guide walks you through a complete example -- from defining tasks and workflows to running locally and deploying remotely.

## What you'll build

By the end of this guide you'll have a working pipeline that looks like this:

```
dataset_cols
    └─▶ feature_prep()    # Ray task: downloads data, splits into train/validation
            └─▶ train()   # Ray task: trains XGBoost model on the splits
```

Each step runs as an isolated, containerized task. Michelangelo AI handles data passing between them, caches intermediate results, and retries on transient failures — your code stays plain Python.

## What you'll learn

* How to define tasks with the `@task` decorator
* How to compose tasks into a workflow with `@workflow`
* How to run pipelines locally and remotely
* How to register and manage pipelines with the `ma` CLI

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.9+
* [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) installed
* Java 17 with `JAVA_HOME` set — required for the Spark preprocessing step. Java 21 is not compatible with PySpark 3.5 + Hadoop 3.3 (`getSubject is not supported` error). On macOS: `brew install openjdk@17` then `export JAVA_HOME=$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home`
* For remote runs: Docker and access to a Kubernetes cluster (or use the [local sandbox](../../getting-started/sandbox-setup.md))
* [Create a project](./project-management-for-ml-pipelines.md)

## Environment setup

Clone the repository and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michelangelo-ai/michelangelo.git
cd michelangelo/python
poetry install -E example
```

This creates a `.venv` directory with all dependencies installed. You can activate it directly or run commands via `poetry run`.

## Core concepts

Before writing code, understand the three building blocks of an ML pipeline:

| Concept | What It Does | Defined With |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Task** | A discrete unit of work (data prep, training, evaluation) that runs in a container | `@uniflow.task()` |
| **Workflow** | Orchestrates tasks in sequence, with branching and loops | `@uniflow.workflow()` |
| **Pipeline** | A deployable instance of a workflow with specific configuration | `pipeline.yaml` |

## Step 1: Define your tasks

Tasks are Python functions decorated with `@uniflow.task()`. Each task runs independently in its own container with configurable compute resources.

```python
import michelangelo.uniflow.core as uniflow
from michelangelo.uniflow.plugins.ray import RayTask
from michelangelo.workflow.variables import DatasetVariable

@uniflow.task(
    config=RayTask(
        head_cpu=1,
        head_gpu=0,
        head_memory="4Gi",
        worker_cpu=1,
        worker_gpu=0,
        worker_memory="4Gi",
        worker_instances=0,
    ),
    cache_enabled=True,
)
def feature_prep(
    columns: list[str],
    test_size: float = 0.25,
    seed: int = 1,
) -> tuple[DatasetVariable, DatasetVariable]:
    """Prepare features from the California Housing dataset.

    Loads the California Housing dataset via scikit-learn, performs a
    train/test split, and converts to Ray Datasets for distributed processing.

    Args:
        columns: List of column names to select (features + ``"target"``).
        test_size: Fraction of data to use for validation. Defaults to 0.25.
        seed: Random seed for reproducibility. Defaults to 1.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (train_dataset, validation_dataset) as DatasetVariables.
    """
    import ray.data
    from sklearn.datasets import fetch_california_housing

    housing = fetch_california_housing(as_frame=True)
    df = housing.frame.rename(columns={"MedHouseVal": "target"})

    data = ray.data.from_pandas(df).select_columns(columns)

    train_data, validation_data = data.train_test_split(
        test_size=test_size, shuffle=True, seed=seed
    )

    train_dv = DatasetVariable.create(train_data)
    train_dv.save_ray_dataset()

    validation_dv = DatasetVariable.create(validation_data)
    validation_dv.save_ray_dataset()

    return train_dv, validation_dv
```

### Choosing a task type

Michelangelo AI supports two compute backends for tasks:

| Task Type | Best For | Example Config |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **RayTask** | Distributed training, GPU workloads, general-purpose compute | `RayTask(head_cpu=2, worker_instances=4)` |
| **SparkTask** | Large-scale data preprocessing, ETL, SQL-based transformations | `SparkTask(driver_cpu=2, executor_instances=4)` |

You can mix both types in a single workflow. Data types automatically convert between frameworks.

## Step 2: Compose a workflow

A workflow orchestrates your tasks. It defines the execution order and passes data between tasks.

```python
@uniflow.workflow()
def train_workflow(dataset_cols: str):
    """Orchestrate the full training pipeline."""
    columns = dataset_cols.split(",")

    # Step 1: Prepare features
    train_dv, validation_dv = feature_prep(columns=columns)

    # Step 2: Train the model
    result = train(
        train_dv=train_dv,
        validation_dv=validation_dv,
        params={
            "objective": "reg:squarederror",
            "colsample_bytree": 0.3,
            "learning_rate": 0.1,
            "max_depth": 5,
            "alpha": 10,
            "n_estimators": 10,
        },
    )
    return result
```

**Important**: Workflow code has restrictions because it compiles to Starlark for production execution. Inside a workflow function, you can only call task functions, other workflows, and built-in functions. See [Workflow constraints](#workflow-constraints) for details.

## Step 3: Run locally

Add a main block to create a context and run the workflow:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ctx = uniflow.create_context()

    # Optionally set different parameters for local vs remote runs
    if ctx.is_local_run():
        ctx.environ["DATASET_SIZE"] = "100"  # small dataset for local testing
    else:
        ctx.environ["DATASET_SIZE"] = "1000000"  # full dataset for remote

    ctx.run(
        train_workflow,
        dataset_cols="MedInc,HouseAge,AveRooms,AveBedrms,Population,AveOccup,Latitude,Longitude,target",
    )
```

The context provides three methods:

| Method | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `ctx.run(fn, **params)` | Execute the workflow function |
| `ctx.environ` | Dict of environment variables to set before execution |
| `ctx.is_local_run()` | Returns `True` if running locally (useful for conditional logic) |

Then run it:

```bash
cd michelangelo/python
PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/pipelines/california_housing_xgb/california_housing_xgb.py
```

Local runs execute everything in your Python interpreter with zero infrastructure setup. This is the fastest way to iterate on your workflow logic.

## Step 4: Run remotely

When you need more compute power or want to validate against production infrastructure, switch to a remote run.

### Build and push a Docker image

```bash
docker build -t my-workflow:latest -f ./examples/Dockerfile .
k3d image import my-workflow:latest -c michelangelo-sandbox
```

### Run with remote execution

```bash
PYTHONPATH=. poetry run python examples/pipelines/california_housing_xgb/california_housing_xgb.py remote-run \
  --image docker.io/library/my-workflow:latest \
  --storage-url s3://my-bucket/workflows \
  --yes
```
**Sandbox storage URL**: the `michelangelo` bucket is created automatically by `ma sandbox create`. For other environments replace with your own S3-compatible bucket URL.

Remote runs execute workflow code in a Cadence/Temporal worker and task code in Kubernetes containers with full resource isolation. For detailed remote setup instructions including sandbox configuration, see [Running Uniflow pipelines](../ml-pipelines/running-uniflow.md).

## Step 5: Register as a pipeline

To manage your workflow through MA Studio and the `ma` CLI, register it as a pipeline.

### Create a project

Pipelines belong to a project. Create one first using the example project config:

```bash
ma project apply -f examples/config/project.yaml
```

This creates the `ma-examples` project with its namespace. The project config at
`examples/config/project.yaml` defines ownership, tier, and repository metadata.
For details on project configuration, see
[Project Management for ML Pipelines](./project-management-for-ml-pipelines.md).

### Create pipeline.yaml

Create a pipeline manifest that references your workflow. The `michelangelo/uniflow-image`
annotation specifies the Docker image that runs your task code in Kubernetes:

```yaml
apiVersion: michelangelo.api/v2
kind: Pipeline
metadata:
  namespace: "ma-examples"
  name: "california-housing-xgb"
  annotations:
    michelangelo/uniflow-image: docker.io/library/my-workflow:latest # Example: ghcr.io/michelangelo-ai/examples:main
spec:
  type: "PIPELINE_TYPE_TRAIN"
  manifest:
    filePath: examples.pipelines.california_housing_xgb.california_housing_xgb
```

The California Housing XGBoost example includes this manifest at
`examples/pipelines/california_housing_xgb/pipeline.yaml`.

> **Sandbox tip:** the `michelangelo/uniflow-image` annotation controls which
> Docker image runs your tasks. For a k3d sandbox, build the image from Step 4
> (`docker build -t my-workflow:latest -f ./examples/Dockerfile .`) and import
> it with `k3d image import`. The `ghcr.io/michelangelo-ai/examples:main`
> image is published by CI for production deployments.

### Register the pipeline

```bash
ma pipeline apply -f examples/pipelines/california_housing_xgb/pipeline.yaml
```

### Run the registered pipeline

```bash
ma pipeline run --namespace ma-examples --name california-housing-xgb
```

## Workflow constraints

Workflow functions compile to Starlark for production execution. This means some Python features are not available inside `@workflow` functions:

| Not Supported | Use Instead |
| --- | --- |
| `import` statements | Call task functions (imports go inside tasks) |
| `try-except` blocks | Use task-level retry |
| `is` / `is not` | `==` / `!=` |
| f-strings | `"{}".format(value)` |
| Chained comparisons (`1 < x < 5`) | `1 < x and x < 5` |
| Standard library calls | Built-in functions (e.g., `uniflow.time()`) |

These constraints only apply to workflow code. Task code runs in containers and can use any Python code.

## Task features

### Caching

Cache task results to skip re-execution on subsequent runs:

```python
@uniflow.task(
    config=RayTask(head_cpu=1, head_memory="4Gi"),
    cache_enabled=True,
    cache_version="v1",
)
def feature_prep(columns: list[str]):
    ...
```

Cached results are available for approximately 28 days (platform-managed). Change `cache_version` to force re-execution.

### Retry

Automatically retry failed tasks:

```python
@uniflow.task(
    config=RayTask(head_cpu=1, head_memory="4Gi"),
    retry_attempts=3,
)
def train(params: dict):
    ...
```

Each retry creates a fresh cluster for better isolation.

### Task overrides

Create task variants with different resource configurations using `with_overrides()`:

```python
@uniflow.workflow()
def train_workflow(dataset_cols: str):
    columns = dataset_cols.split(",")

    # Run feature_prep with more resources
    large_feature_prep = feature_prep.with_overrides(
        alias="large_feature_prep",
        config=RayTask(head_cpu=2, worker_instances=2),
    )
    train_dv, validation_dv = large_feature_prep(columns=columns)
    ...
```

**Important**: The override config **replaces** the original config entirely -- it does not merge fields. Specify all required fields in the override.

## Complete example

See the full California Housing XGBoost example at [`python/examples/pipelines/california_housing_xgb/`](https://github.com/michelangelo-ai/michelangelo/tree/main/python/examples/pipelines/california_housing_xgb). This example demonstrates:

* **Heterogeneous workflow**: Ray tasks for data prep and training, Spark task for preprocessing
* **Task caching**: Reuse feature preparation results across runs
* **Task overrides**: Customize resource allocation per workflow
* **DatasetVariable**: Pass datasets between tasks across different compute frameworks

* [Model Training](../train-and-deploy-models/train-and-register-a-model.md) -- Advanced distributed training with Lightning Trainer SDK

## Troubleshooting

* **Out of memory during training?** Increase `head_memory` or `worker_memory` in your task config, or reduce your dataset size for local runs.
* **Remote run fails to start?** Verify your Docker image exists and is accessible. Check that `--storage-url` points to a valid S3-compatible bucket.
* **Workflow code errors with "not supported in Starlark"?** Move the unsupported syntax (imports, try-except, f-strings) into a task function. See [Workflow constraints](#workflow-constraints).
* **Spark fails with `getSubject is not supported`?** Java 21 is incompatible with PySpark 3.5 + Hadoop 3.3. Switch to Java 17: `brew install openjdk@17` then `export JAVA_HOME=$(brew --prefix openjdk@17)/libexec/openjdk.jdk/Contents/Home`.

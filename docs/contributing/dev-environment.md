# Go and Bazel Development Setup

This guide is for developers contributing to Michelangelo AI's Go backend services (API server, controller manager, worker). If you're building ML pipelines with the Python SDK, see [Python IDE Setup](../getting-started/setup-python-ide.md) instead.

## Go IDE Setup

### VS Code / Cursor

1. Install [Go](https://go.dev/doc/install) and verify with `go version`.
2. Install [gopls](https://github.com/golang/tools/blob/master/gopls/doc/index.md) (the Go language server).
3. Open the michelangelo root folder in VS Code / Cursor.
4. When you open a `.go` file, you should see "Setting up workspace: Loading packages..." in the status bar. Once complete, autocomplete, go-to-definition, and other language server features will work.

### GoLand / IntelliJ

1. Install the **Bazel for IntelliJ** plugin: GoLand > Settings > Plugins > search "Bazel for IntelliJ".
2. Open the **workspace root directory** (not the `/go` directory) as your project root.
3. The plugin indexes dependency libraries and proto-generated Go files automatically.
4. After changing Bazel files (e.g., after running Gazelle), click the green Bazel icon in the top-right corner to re-sync.

## Bazel Configuration

### macOS C++ Compiler

If Bazel fails with C++ build errors on macOS, add these lines to your `~/.zshrc`:

```bash
export CC=clang
export CXX=clang++
```

Then restart your terminal or run `source ~/.zshrc`.

### GoLand Bazel Wrapper

GoLand doesn't automatically load `.envrc` files. To make it use the command-line tools in the `tools/` directory, create a wrapper script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# GoLand always calls bazel from the project root directory.
export PATH=${PWD}/tools:${PATH}
bazel "$@"
```

Save this script (e.g., as `~/bin/bazel-goland.sh`), make it executable with `chmod +x`, and set it as the Bazel binary in GoLand > Settings > Other Settings > Bazel Settings.

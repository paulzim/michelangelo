# How to Write APIs
This guide walks through the steps for building and compiling Protocol Buffers (Protos) of ML entities in the Michelangelo AI using Bazel and Gazelle.

## 1. ML Entities in Proto Files

Define entities in protobuf in [michelangelo/proto/api/v2](https://github.com/michelangelo-ai/michelangelo/tree/main/proto-go/api/v2).

## 2. Generate gRPC Service Code
If ML entities are exposed using gRPC services, ensure that the appropriate gRPC code is generated. This usually involves running a go generate command or ensuring Gazelle is configured to handle proto_library and go_proto_library targets for gRPC.

```
# Generate service proto files
tools/grpc-svc-gen.sh [Entity]

# Example for Pipeline
tools/grpc-svc-gen.sh Pipeline
```

## 3. Generate Proto Files with Gazelle
Before building, make sure all proto files are properly indexed and generated with [Gazelle](https://github.com/bazelbuild/bazel-gazelle), which automatically updates BUILD files for Protocol Buffers:

```
tools/gazelle
```
This will scan your proto directories and update BUILD targets accordingly.

## 4. Build Proto Files
Use Bazel to build the proto targets. This will ensure your .pb.go and other generated files are correctly compiled.
```
bazel build //proto/...
```
To see more detailed error output (helpful for debugging), add the --verbose_failures flag:
```
bazel build //proto/... --verbose_failures
```

## 5. Generate and check in Go code from protobuf
The repository also publishes generated Go protobuf sources under `proto-go/`
for users who build with standard `go` tooling (not Bazel). After changing
any `.proto` file, regenerate and check in the generated code so those users
stay in sync.

```
tools/gen-proto-go.sh
```

This script will:
- build `//proto/...` with Bazel to generate `.pb.go` files,
- copy generated files into `proto-go/`,
- sync dependency versions from `go/go.mod` into `proto-go/go.mod`, and
- run `go mod tidy` in `proto-go/`.

Always edit dependency versions in `go/go.mod` and use this script to keep
`proto-go/go.mod` consistent.

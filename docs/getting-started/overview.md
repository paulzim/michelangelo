# Overview

Michelangelo is an end-to-end ML platform that manages the full model lifecycle — training, versioning, deployment, and monitoring — on Kubernetes, so ML teams can ship models without building infrastructure from scratch.

## Choose Your Path

Pick the approach that matches your workflow and expertise:

### UI Path — Start Here If You:
- Want to **quickly experiment** with standard ML models (XGBoost, Classic ML, Deep Learning)
- Prefer **visual workflows** over writing code
- Are a **business analyst or product manager** building predictive models
- Need to **prototype rapidly** before investing in custom code

**Quick Start**:
1. Navigate to MA Studio (available at your Michelangelo deployment URL, or `http://localhost:8090` in the [local sandbox](./sandbox-setup.md))
2. Create a new project and define your use case
3. Prepare your dataset using the Data Prep interface
4. Train a model using pre-built templates
5. Evaluate results and deploy

**Best for**: Classification, regression, time series forecasting with standard features

### Code Path — Choose This If You:
- Need **custom ML pipelines** with specialized preprocessing
- Want **full control** over training loops, model architectures, or data transformations
- Are building **production-grade workflows** that need to run on schedules
- Have **complex dependencies** between multiple ML tasks
- Want to apply **software engineering practices** to ML (testing, version control, CI/CD)

**Quick Start**:
1. Install Michelangelo SDK: `pip install michelangelo`
2. Define your workflow using Uniflow decorators (`@uniflow.task`, `@uniflow.workflow`)
3. Submit a dev-run to the Michelangelo API server (see [Sandbox Setup](./sandbox-setup.md))
4. Monitor execution through the UI

**Best for**: Custom architectures, multi-stage pipelines, A/B testing frameworks, feature engineering at scale

### Hybrid Approach

Many teams start with the **UI for initial experiments**, then transition to **code for production workflows**. You can:
- Train initial models in the UI to validate feasibility
- Export YAML configurations from the UI and extend them in CanvasFlex, or rebuild in Uniflow
- Use the UI for monitoring while managing training/deployment pipelines

## ML Workflow Mapping

If you're coming from other ML platforms, here's how familiar concepts map to Michelangelo:

| Your Workflow | Familiar Tool | Michelangelo Equivalent |
|---------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| **Data Preparation** | Pandas, Spark notebooks | **MA Studio Data Prep** or **Uniflow tasks** with Ray/Spark * |
| **Experiment Tracking** | MLflow, Weights & Biases | **Model Registry** with automatic versioning |
| **Model Training** | Custom scripts, Kubeflow Pipelines | **MA Studio Training** (UI) or **CanvasFlex/Uniflow workflows** (code) |
| **Hyperparameter Tuning** | Optuna, Ray Tune | **Uniflow tasks** with Ray Tune * |
| **Model Storage** | S3 buckets, model registries | **Michelangelo Model Registry** with metadata & plugin storage |
| **Batch Inference** | Airflow + custom scripts | **Deployment to batch endpoint** with offline inference pipeline and Ray / Triton Inference * |
| **Online Serving** | TorchServe, TensorFlow Serving | **Deployment to inference server** with Triton Inference Server * |
| **Monitoring** | Prometheus + Grafana | **Model Excellence Scores** + built-in monitoring * |
| **Pipeline Orchestration** | Airflow, Prefect, Temporal | **Uniflow workflows** with Cadence/Temporal backend * |

_* Can be replaced by the plugin system for custom integrations_

## What's In the Box

### MA Studio (No-Code UI)

The MA Studio UI provides a standard, code-free ML development experience. It guides you through the different phases of the ML development lifecycle, providing all the essential tools to build, train, deploy, monitor, and debug your machine learning models in a single unified visual interface.

You can use the no-code environment to perform standardized ML tasks without writing a single line of code, including:
* Prepare data sources for training models or making batch predictions
* Build and train XGB models, classic ML models, and Deep Learning models
* Compare trained model performance and debug model issues
* Deploy the models for making predictions
* Monitor model performance in production
* Debug production model and data issues

### CanvasFlex

CanvasFlex is an opinionated, YAML-based workflow system for teams who want predefined best practices with code-driven customization. For more advanced tasks — custom retraining workflows, bespoke performance monitoring, DL model training — CanvasFlex provides a predefined ML workflow with best practices applied. Manage pipelines visually while writing the logic in code.

### Uniflow

Uniflow is a Python orchestration framework for ML pipelines. Wrap your functions with `@uniflow.task` and `@uniflow.workflow` decorators to get distributed execution, automatic data passing between tasks, caching, and retries — without changing your model code.

```python
import michelangelo.uniflow.core as uniflow
from michelangelo.uniflow.plugins.ray import RayTask

@uniflow.task(config=RayTask(head_cpu=2, head_memory="4Gi"))
def train_model(data_path: str):
    return train_my_model(data_path)

@uniflow.workflow()
def training_pipeline(data_path: str):
    model = train_model(data_path)
    return model
```

## Architecture

Machine learning at scale requires coordinating many moving parts: data preparation, experiment tracking, model training, deployment, and monitoring. Michelangelo provides an integrated ecosystem that handles all of these concerns, enabling teams to focus on building great models rather than managing infrastructure.

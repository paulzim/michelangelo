## System Components
These are the frameworks, interfaces, and compute engines provided by Michelangelo AI to facilitate development.

### Orchestration & Interfaces

#### MA Studio (No Code UI)

**MA Studio** is Michelangelo AI's UI environment. The standard, code-free ML development experience guides users through the different phases of the ML development lifecycle. This environment provides all the essential tools which allow ML developers to build, train, deploy, monitor, and debug your machine learning models in a single unified visual interface to boost your productivity. 

Users can use the no-code dev environment to perform standardized ML tasks without writing a single line of code, including:
* Prepare data sources for training models or making batch predictions
* Build and train XGB models, classic ML models, and Deep Learning models

#### CanvasFlex (Code Driven YAML/UI)

**CanvasFlex** is an opinionated predefined ML workflow designed for more advanced tasks with best practices, such as training DL models, setting up customized retraining workflows, building bespoke model performance monitoring workflows. CanvasFlex provides a highly customized, code driven ML development experience by applying software development principles to ML development. Users can create their own dependencies that can be managed in the UI environment.

#### Uniflow (Orchestration Framework)

**Uniflow** is a Python orchestration framework for AI/ML pipelines. It enables you to modularize your computation into **tasks**, chain them into **workflows**, and manage input/output artifacts efficiently.

### Execution & Infrastructure

#### Tasks

A **task** is the fundamental unit of computation in Uniflow. Tasks are modular and self-contained, enabling reuse and scalability.

##### Key Features
- **Input and Output Handling**: Tasks process input data and produce outputs.
- **Caching**: Automatically caches results to prevent redundant computations.
- **Retry Mechanism**: Built-in retries for transient failures.
- **Containerized Execution**: Tasks run in isolated environments (Docker, K8s) for scalability.

```python
import michelangelo.uniflow.core as uniflow
from michelangelo.uniflow.plugins.ray import RayTask

@uniflow.task(config=RayTask(head_cpu=2, head_memory="4Gi"))
def train():
    print("training")
```

---
#### Workflows

A **workflow** orchestrates multiple tasks, managing dependencies and result passing.

```python
@uniflow.workflow()
def train_workflow(dataset_id: str):
    train_data, valid_data, test_data = load_dataset(dataset_id)
    model = train(train_data, valid_data, test_data)
    metrics = evaluate(model, test_data)
    return metrics
```

To run:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    ctx = uniflow.create_context()
    ctx.run(train_workflow, dataset_id="cola")
```

---

#### Job

A batch job running a ML workload. Currently Michelangelo AI runs [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/index.html) for data processing and [Ray](https://www.ray.io/) for ML training.

#### Compute Resource

These are hardware resources (CPU, GPU, memory, storage, etc) for running Machine Learning workloads.


#### Inference Server

Inference Server is synonymous with the Online Inference Service, and is essentially the host for use-cases that require online inference.

## ML Concepts
These are the logical entities, data structures, and artifacts that define your machine learning use case.

### Project

A business use case with a set of continuously trackable metrics.

**Familiar Equivalent**: Similar to an MLflow experiment or Weights & Biases project, but encompasses the entire ML lifecycle from data preparation to deployment monitoring. Think of it as the top-level organizational unit for all work related to one business problem.

**Examples**:
-   Predicting customer churn for a subscription service
-   Fraud detection for financial transactions
-   Recommending products on an e-commerce homepage
-   Predicting delivery time estimates for a logistics platform

### Model Family

A Model Family is a group of related ML models within a project that address different aspects of the same use case, each with distinct training features and objectives. Use Model Families when multiple models work together to solve one business problem.

**Familiar Equivalent**: Similar to organizing multiple models within one Kubeflow or SageMaker pipeline, where each model has a specific role in solving the overall problem.

:::warning[Common Confusion]
- A **Model** is a single trained artifact (e.g., one XGBoost classifier)
- A **Model Family** is a group of models solving related sub-problems (e.g., three models for conversion, quality, and fairness in ranking)
:::

**Examples**:
-   Model excellence scores track the quality of each model family
-   A home feed ranking system uses different model families optimizing for conversion rate, content quality, and fairness

### Dataset

A piece of data registered in Michelangelo AI. Users can set up data pipelines and let Michelangelo AI manage the dataset, or directly register the dataset in Michelangelo AI and manage it externally. They can use the dataset for training and evaluation.

**Familiar Equivalent**: Like registering a dataset in a data catalog (e.g., Delta Lake, Data Version Control, or AWS Glue Data Catalog). Michelangelo AI tracks dataset versions and lineage automatically.

### Feature

An individual measurable property or characteristic of a phenomenon, represented as an attribute in a dataset.

**Familiar Equivalent**: Same as in any ML framework - a column in your training data (e.g., "age", "transaction_amount", "embedding_vector"). Can be managed in external feature stores or within Michelangelo AI.

### Pipeline

A pipeline is a recipe that runs multiple jobs and creates desired output artifacts.

**Familiar Equivalent**: Similar to Airflow DAGs, Prefect flows, or Kubeflow pipelines - a series of data processing and ML tasks executed in sequence or parallel.

### Model & Revision

As a widely used term, a machine learning model refers to output from a training job over a set of data, providing it an algorithm that it can use to reason over, learn from, and make predictions about that data.

     **model name:**  identifier of a model, it also means a list of models (like a chain) in the incremental training case.

     **revision id:** Revision of the model, for normal model, it will always be revision 0. But for incremental training, the revision id will keep increasing for each iteration of the model training job.

### Evaluation Report

Collection of model metrics. Some examples are model performance report, feature importance report, data quality report, etc.

### Model Excellence Scores

Model Excellence Scores (MES) provide visibility into the ML model quality throughout various stages of a model’s life cycle, such as feature quality, prediction performance, and model freshness.

### Deployment

Runs a set of processes to load a model into a target. Provides a human readable name for accessing a model.

### Endpoint

The routing mechanism for making requests to a group of deployments.


## Output Artifacts

### Task Results

Serialized outputs stored by Uniflow for caching, debugging, or reuse in downstream tasks.

Example:

```json
[
  {
    "url": "s3://default/1a52588fb9774306ab6b112485bdb71e",
    "type": {"path": "ray.data.dataset.Dataset"},
    "__class__": "michelangelo.uniflow.core.ref.Ref"
  }
]
```

Features:
- **Dataset References** with URLs
- **Type Information**
- **Metadata** (optional)

---

### Data Checkpoints

Intermediate datasets are stored using Uniflow's abstract IO layer for:
- Fault tolerance
- Reuse across executions
- Backend flexibility (S3, HDFS, Ray, etc.)

---

## Supported Data Types

Uniflow tasks support standard Python types plus ML-specific formats:

| Type Category | Supported Types | Use Case |
|---------------|----------------|----------|
| **Primitives** | int, float, str, bool | Simple parameters and return values |
| **Collections** | dict, list, tuple | Multiple values, configurations |
| **Structured** | dataclass, Pydantic models | Complex typed configurations, validation |
| **ML Artifacts** | Ray Datasets, model files via Ref | Large datasets, trained models |
| **Files** | Paths with s3://, hdfs://, file:// | Reading/writing data from storage |
| **Remote References** | Ref pointers | Lightweight references to heavy objects |

**Key Features**:
- **Automatic serialization**: Uniflow handles serialization/deserialization automatically
- **Type safety**: Use Python type hints for better error checking
- **Caching**: Results are cached based on input types and values
- **Protocol support**: Access files via s3://, hdfs://, file:// (via [fsspec](https://filesystem-spec.readthedocs.io/))

**Common Patterns**:
```python
# Simple typed task
@uniflow.task()
def add_numbers(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    return a + b

# Structured config with Pydantic
from pydantic import BaseModel

class ModelConfig(BaseModel):
    learning_rate: float
    batch_size: int

@uniflow.task()
def train(config: ModelConfig):
    # Training code using config.learning_rate, config.batch_size
    pass

# Remote dataset reference (avoids copying large data)
@uniflow.task()
def process_data(dataset_ref: Ref) -> Ref:
    # Process dataset without loading entire thing into memory
    return processed_ref
```

See [Data Type Examples](../user-guides/reference/type-system.md#appendix-uniflow-data-type-examples) for detailed examples of each type.

---

## Logs and Monitoring

- **Pipeline Logs**: Viewable through Kubernetes, `ma`, or Cadence UI.
- **Audit & Debugging**: All execution results and logs can be persisted and traced back.

---

## Example: Build a Pipeline

```python
@uniflow.workflow()
def train_workflow(dataset_id: str):
    train_data, valid_data, test_data = load_dataset(dataset_id)
    model = train(train_data, valid_data, test_data)
    metrics = evaluate(model, test_data)
    return metrics
```

Run it:

```bash
python train_workflow.py
```

## How Concepts Relate

Understanding how Michelangelo AI's concepts work together:

```
Project (e.g., "Fraud Detection")
├── Model Family 1 (Transaction Scoring)
│   ├── Dataset (Historical Transactions)
│   ├── Workflow (Data Prep → Training → Evaluation)
│   │   ├── Task: prepare_data()
│   │   ├── Task: train_model()
│   │   └── Task: evaluate()
│   ├── Model Revision 0 (XGBoost v1)
│   ├── Model Revision 1 (XGBoost v2 - retrained)
│   ├── Deployment (fraud-scoring-prod)
│   └── Endpoint (https://api.../fraud-scoring)
└── Model Family 2 (User Risk Profiling)
    ├── Dataset (User Behavior)
    ├── Workflow (Feature Engineering → Training)
    └── Model Revision 0 (Random Forest)
```

**Key Relationships**:
- **Project** contains one or more **Model Families**
- **Model Families** use **Datasets** and produce **Models**
- **Workflows** orchestrate **Tasks** to transform data and train models
- **Models** have multiple **Revisions** (versions)
- **Deployments** serve specific **Model Revisions** via **Endpoints**

---

## Common Workflows

### Training Your First Model

1. **Create a Project** for your use case (e.g., "Customer Churn Prediction")
2. **Register your Dataset** in Michelangelo AI (connect to data warehouse)
3. **Define a Workflow** with training tasks (or use MA Studio UI for no-code approach)
4. **Run the workflow** and track results in Model Registry
5. **Create a Deployment** to serve predictions via an Endpoint

**MA Studio (UI) Path**:
```
Navigate to MA Studio → Create Project → Connect Dataset →
Train Model (select XGBoost) → Evaluate → Deploy
```

**Uniflow (Code) Path**:
```python
@uniflow.task(config=RayTask(head_cpu=2, head_memory="4Gi"))
def train_model(dataset):
    # Your training code
    return model

@uniflow.workflow()
def training_pipeline(dataset_id: str):
    data = load_dataset(dataset_id)
    model = train_model(data)
    return model
```

### Retraining an Existing Model

1. **Update Dataset** with new data (or existing dataset)
2. **Run Workflow** with training workflow
3. **New Revision** created automatically with revision 0
4. **Update Deployment** to new model (instant rollback available if needed)

### Incremental Training an Existing Model

1. **Reference existing Model** by name from your Project
2. **Update Dataset** with new data (or create new dataset version)
3. **Run Workflow** with incremental training enabled
4. **New Revision** created automatically (e.g., revision 0 → revision 1)
5. **Update Deployment** to new revision (instant rollback available if needed)

### Deploying for A/B Testing

1. **Deploy Model Revision 1** to 90% of traffic
2. **Deploy Model Revision 2** to 10% of traffic (same Endpoint)
3. **Monitor metrics** per revision using Model Excellence Scores
4. **Gradually shift traffic** to winning revision
5. **Rollback instantly** if issues detected

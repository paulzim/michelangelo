# Monitoring & Observability

This guide is for platform operators setting up observability for a Michelangelo AI deployment.

**Prerequisites**: A running Michelangelo AI control plane with the controller manager deployed. Familiarity with [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator) is helpful but not required.

Michelangelo AI components expose Prometheus metrics that integrate with a standard Kubernetes observability stack. This guide covers scrape configuration, key metrics to monitor, alerting rules, and logging configuration.

## Prometheus Scrape Configuration

### Controller Manager

The controller manager exposes metrics on port `8091` (configured via `metricsBindAddress`). If you are using the [Prometheus Operator](https://github.com/prometheus-operator/prometheus-operator), create a `ServiceMonitor`:

```yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: michelangelo-controllermgr
  namespace: ma-system
  labels:
    app: michelangelo-controllermgr
spec:
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: michelangelo-controllermgr
  endpoints:
  - port: metrics          # Must match the Service port name for port 8091
    path: /metrics
    interval: 30s
```

### Health Probes

The controller manager exposes health endpoints on port `8083` (configured via `healthProbeBindAddress`):

| Endpoint | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `GET :8083/healthz` | Liveness — is the process alive? |
| `GET :8083/readyz` | Readiness — is the controller ready to reconcile? |

These are used by Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes, but you can also poll them from your monitoring stack for coarser-grained health checks.

### API Server

The API server (port `15566`) exposes standard gRPC metrics. If you have a Prometheus scrape job for gRPC services, point it at the API server pod.

### Envoy Proxy

Envoy can expose an admin stats interface for scraping request counts, latency histograms, and upstream error rates. The admin interface is **not enabled by default** in the Michelangelo AI Envoy configuration — you must add an `admin:` block to your Envoy ConfigMap to enable it. See the [Envoy admin documentation](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/operations/admin) for setup instructions. Once enabled, add a Prometheus scrape job targeting the admin port.

## Key Metrics

### Pipeline Runs

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `pipelinerun_result_total` | Pipeline run results, by `state`, `pipeline_type`, `environment`, `tier` | Count |
| `pipelinerun_result_failure_total` | Failed pipeline runs, with `failure_reason` label | Count |
| `pipelinerun_duration_seconds` | Pipeline run execution duration (histogram) | Seconds |
| `pipelinerun_failed` | Gauge: 1 if most recent run failed, 0 if succeeded | Gauge |
| `pipelinerun_step_success_total` | Step completions, by `step_name` and `pipeline_type` | Count |
| `pipeline_ready_total` | Pipelines reaching Ready state | Count |

### Workflow Engine

Workflow metrics are emitted by the Cadence or Temporal server, not by Michelangelo AI. Consult your workflow engine's documentation for its native Prometheus metrics. Michelangelo AI's worker-side reconcile metrics are captured under the `pipelinerun_*` counters above.

### Model Serving (Envoy)

If you have enabled the Envoy admin interface, these standard Envoy metrics are available:

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_total` | Total requests to inference backends | Count |
| `envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_5xx` | 5xx error responses from inference backends | Count |
| `envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_time` | Request latency histogram to inference servers | Seconds |

### Controller Manager Health

The controller manager uses `controller-runtime` metrics — these are standard across all Kubernetes operators:

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total` | Reconcile errors, by `controller` label | Count |
| `controller_runtime_reconcile_time_seconds` | Reconcile duration histogram | Seconds |
| `workqueue_depth` | Work items queued, by `name` label (one per controller) | Count |
| `workqueue_retries_total` | Work item retries — elevated value indicates persistent failures | Count |

### Cascade Delete

Always emitted by the controller manager — see the [Cascade Delete](../cascade-delete.md) guide for the feature overview.

| Metric | Description | Unit |
|--------|-------------|------|
| `cascade_owner_ref_backfill_total` | ownerReference backfills performed, by `kind` | Count |
| `cascade_child_drain_duration_seconds` | Time a child spent draining (histogram), by `kind` | Seconds |
| `cascade_child_drain_timeout_total` | Children whose drain exceeded the 24h safety timeout, by `kind` | Count |
| `cascade_child_drain_active` | Number of children currently draining (gauge), by `kind` | Count |

The `kind` label is a stable dashboard/alerting **contract**: its value is always exactly `pipeline_run` or `trigger_run`. Build queries and alerts against those two values.

## Alerting Rules

Add these rules to your Prometheus configuration:

```yaml
groups:
- name: michelangelo
  rules:

  # Pipeline run failure rate
  - alert: PipelineRunFailureRateHigh
    expr: rate(pipelinerun_result_failure_total[5m]) > 0
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Pipeline run failures detected"
      description: >
        Pipeline runs are failing at {{ $value | humanize }} failures/sec.
        Check failure reasons: kubectl -n ma-system get pipelineruns --field-selector status.phase=Failed

  # Pipeline run duration: P99 above 1 hour
  - alert: PipelineRunDurationHigh
    expr: >
      histogram_quantile(0.99,
        rate(pipelinerun_duration_seconds_bucket[5m])
      ) > 3600
    for: 10m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:

  # Controller reconcile errors — sustained error rate from any controller
  - alert: ControllerReconcileErrorRate
    expr: rate(controller_runtime_reconcile_errors_total[5m]) > 0.1
    for: 5m

      description: >
        The {{ $labels.controller }} controller is failing reconciles at
        {{ $value | humanize }} errors/sec. Check logs:
        kubectl -n ma-system logs deployment/michelangelo-controllermgr

  # Inference latency: P99 above 500ms for 5 minutes
  - alert: InferenceLatencyHigh
    expr: >
      histogram_quantile(0.99,
        rate(envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_time_bucket[5m])
      ) > 500
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Inference P99 latency is above 500ms"
      description: >
        The 99th percentile inference request latency is {{ $value }}ms.
        Check InferenceServer and model-sync sidecar logs.

  # Inference error rate: more than 1% of requests returning 5xx
  - alert: InferenceErrorRateHigh
    expr: >
      rate(envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_5xx[5m])
      / rate(envoy_cluster_upstream_rq_total[5m]) > 0.01
    for: 5m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Inference 5xx error rate above 1%"
      description: >
        {{ $value | humanizePercentage }} of inference requests are returning 5xx errors.

  # Cascade delete: safety timeout force-completed a child's drain
  - alert: CascadeChildDrainTimeout
    expr: increase(cascade_child_drain_timeout_total[1h]) > 0
    for: 0m
    labels:
      severity: warning
    annotations:
      summary: "Cascade delete safety timeout fired"
      description: >
        {{ $value }} child resource(s) were force-killed because their drain
        did not complete within 24 hours. Investigate why the drain was wedged:
        kubectl -n ma-system logs deployment/michelangelo-controllermgr | grep -i "cascade\|force"
```

## Structured Logging

All Michelangelo AI components emit structured logs. Configure log format and level in the relevant ConfigMap:

```yaml
logging:
  level: info          # debug | info | warn | error
  development: false   # true enables human-readable console output
  encoding: json       # json for production; console for development
```

For production deployments use `encoding: json` so your log aggregation system (Loki, Elasticsearch, CloudWatch Logs, etc.) can parse and query fields natively.

### Important log fields to index

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `level` | Log severity |
| `logger` | Component/controller name |
| `msg` | Log message |
| `namespace` | Kubernetes resource namespace |
| `name` | Kubernetes resource name |
| `operation` | Controller operation (e.g., `create_ray_cluster`, `schedule_job`) |
| `error` | Error message (present on error-level logs) |

Indexing these fields allows you to efficiently query all events for a specific resource (`namespace` + `name`), filter by controller (`logger`), or find all failures across the control plane (`level: error`).

## What's Next

- **Troubleshooting**: Use the collected metrics and logs to diagnose issues with the [Troubleshooting guide](./troubleshooting.md)
- **Authentication**: Secure access to your metrics endpoints with the [Authentication guide](../setup/authentication.md)
- **Compliance**: Set up audit log retention to meet SOC 2, GDPR, or HIPAA requirements in the [Compliance guide](./compliance.md)

# Michelangelo AI Jobs

Michelangelo AI provides a unified way to run large-scale data processing and ML training jobs on Kubernetes, using **Ray** and **Spark** as execution engines. This guide explains *the core concepts*, how jobs run, compute is allocated, and how users interact with the system.

## **What Is a Michelangelo AI Job?**

A Michelangelo AI job is any workload—training, batch inference, ETL, feature generation—that runs on a managed compute cluster.
Users define *what to run*, and Michelangelo AI handles:

* Selecting a compute cluster
* Creating the necessary Ray or Spark resources
* Running the workload
* Streaming logs/status
* Cleaning up when finished

You focus on the job logic; Michelangelo AI manages the infrastructure.

## **Architecture**

The image below displays the Michelangelo AI (MA) architecture for running Spark and Ray batch jobs end-to-end: submission, scheduling, execution, and reporting.

## **How Jobs Run**

The execution flow is very similar across Ray and Spark:

1. **Submit**
   Your pipeline or service submits a job request to Michelangelo AI.
2. **Schedule & Assign**
   Michelangelo AI chooses a compute cluster based on quotas, resource needs, and policies.
3. **Materialize on Compute**
   The system creates the appropriate resources in the target cluster:
   * Ray: `RayCluster` + `RayJob`
   * Spark: `SparkApplication`
4. **Execute the Workload**
   The job runs on the generated compute cluster.
   Autoscaling brings up or down workers as needed.
5. **Monitor & Complete**
   Michelangelo AI collects logs, metrics and job status.
   After completion, compute resources follow retention/TTL policies.

This mirrors the same control-plane to compute-plane flow seen in platforms like **Databricks** and **Kubeflow**.

## **Choosing Ray or Spark**

| Engine | Best For | Why |
| ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Ray** | ML training, Python-native preprocessing, GPU workloads | Flexible execution, actors, distributed training, great for deep learning |
| **Spark** | Large-scale ETL, SQL/DataFrame pipelines, joins/aggregations | Mature, optimized shuffle engine, strong SQL performance |

A simple rule:

* **If your workload is Python/ML/GPU → use Ray**
* **If your workload is SQL/ETL/joins → use Spark**

## **What You Need to Specify**

Michelangelo AI abstracts away most of the details. Users only provide the essentials:

### **For Ray jobs**

* The **container image** with your training code
* The **entrypoint** (e.g., `python train.py`)
* Desired **head/worker compute sizing**
* Optional: min/max workers for autoscaling

### **For Spark jobs**

* Your **application file** (Python or JAR)
* Application **arguments**
* Driver/executor resource sizes
* Optional: dynamic allocation configuration

## **Observability & Operations**

Michelangelo AI automatically provides:

* Job status and lifecycle events
* Logs from driver/head + workers
* Optional access to Ray Dashboard or Spark UI
* Automatic cleanup via TTL policies

Retries, check-pointing, and error handling depend on your application code.

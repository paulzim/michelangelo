# Operator Guides

These guides cover deploying, configuring, and integrating Michelangelo in a Kubernetes environment. They target platform engineers and infrastructure operators who are responsible for running Michelangelo in production and for connecting it to the broader ML infrastructure their teams already use — experiment tracking, model registries, compute clusters, schedulers, and serving frameworks.

## Getting Started

For a fresh deployment, follow this recommended reading order:

1. **[Platform Setup](platform-setup.md)** — configure each component (API server, controller manager, worker, UI/Envoy) via ConfigMaps and Kustomize overlays
2. **[Register a Compute Cluster](jobs/register-a-compute-cluster-to-michelangelo-control-plane.md)** — connect an existing Kubernetes cluster so Michelangelo can dispatch Ray and Spark jobs to it
3. **[Cluster Setup for Serving](serving/cluster-setup.md)** — enable model inference on a local or remote cluster
4. **[Authentication](authentication.md)** — connect an identity provider and configure RBAC before opening to users

## Platform Configuration

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Platform Setup](platform-setup.md) | ConfigMaps and key fields for API server, controller manager, worker, and UI/Envoy |
| [Network & Ingress](network.md) | Envoy proxy, Ingress setup, TLS with cert-manager, and multi-cluster connectivity |
| [API Framework](api-framework.md) | Architecture overview of the Michelangelo API and control plane |
| [SQL Key Concepts and Terms](sql-key-concepts-and-terms.md) | Metadata schema, table naming, indexed fields, and SQL query patterns |

## Jobs & Compute

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Jobs Overview](jobs/index.md) | Ray and Spark job lifecycle, compute selection, and observability |
| [Register a Compute Cluster](jobs/register-a-compute-cluster-to-michelangelo-control-plane.md) | Connect an existing Kubernetes cluster to the Michelangelo control plane |
| [Run a Pipeline on a Compute Cluster](jobs/run-uniflow-pipeline-on-compute-cluster.md) | Submit and monitor a Uniflow pipeline on a registered cluster |
| [Extend the Job Scheduler](jobs/extend-michelangelo-batch-job-scheduler-system.md) | Custom scheduling backends (Kueue, Volcano) and assignment strategies |

## Model Serving

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Serving Overview](serving/index.md) | InferenceServer and Deployment lifecycle, architecture |
| [Cluster Setup for Serving](serving/cluster-setup.md) | Configure a cluster for inference |
| [Integrate a Custom Backend](serving/integrate-custom-backend.md) | Plugin interfaces for Triton, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, and custom frameworks |

## UI

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Deploying the UI](ui/deploying-michelangelo-ui.md) | Deploy the Michelangelo web UI to Kubernetes |
| [Local UI Development](ui/local-development-setup.md) | Run the UI locally for development |

## Integrating with Your ML Stack

Michelangelo is designed to be adopted alongside existing ML infrastructure. These guides cover how to connect Michelangelo to the systems your teams already use.

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Model Registry](model-registry.md) | Operate Michelangelo's built-in model registry, configure storage and RBAC, and integrate with serving and CI/CD |
| [Experiment Tracking Setup](experiment-tracking.md) | Make an experiment tracking server reachable from task pods — network, ConfigMap injection, auth, and operator/user boundary |
| [Third-Party Integrations](integrations/index.md) | Connect external tools (MLflow, and more) to Michelangelo workloads |
| [Custom Serving Backend](serving/integrate-custom-backend.md) | Add support for any inference framework — Triton, vLLM, TensorRT-LLM, or your own |
| [Custom Job Scheduler](jobs/extend-michelangelo-batch-job-scheduler-system.md) | Replace or extend the job scheduler — integrate Kueue, Volcano, or a custom assignment strategy |
| [Register a Compute Cluster](jobs/register-a-compute-cluster-to-michelangelo-control-plane.md) | Connect an existing Kubernetes cluster so Michelangelo can dispatch jobs to it |

## Operations

| Guide | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [Authentication](authentication.md) | OIDC identity provider setup, RBAC, session configuration, multi-tenant isolation |
| [Monitoring & Observability](monitoring.md) | Prometheus scrape config, key metrics, alerting rules, Grafana dashboards, structured logging |
| [Compliance](compliance.md) | SOC 2, GDPR, and HIPAA configuration |
| [Troubleshooting](troubleshooting.md) | Common failure modes and `kubectl` diagnostic commands |

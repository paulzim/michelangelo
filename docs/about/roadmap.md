# Roadmap

Michelangelo is under active development. This page captures the current state of the platform and the direction we're headed. Things will shift as priorities evolve and the community gives feedback.

## Release Milestones

The OSS release is staged so each version makes a specific, scoped promise rather than trying to be everything at once.

| Version | Target | Focus |
|---|---|---|
| **0.1.2** | June 2026 | Core pipeline platform — UniFlow, Ray, pipeline and run management, MA CLI and Studio |
| **1.0** | July 2026 | End-to-end LLM model management — fine-tuning, model registry, progressive serving, full lineage |
| **1.1** | Q3 2026 | Agent + LLM Gateway — K8s-native containerized agent jobs, deployment-aware LLM routing |

## Versioning Policy

Michelangelo follows [Semantic Versioning 2.0.0](https://semver.org/) with stability declared per component, not per repository.

| Tier | Guarantee |
|---|---|
| **stable** | Backwards-compatible across all minor and patch versions within a major. Breaking changes only at the next major. |
| **beta** | API may change between minor versions. Migration notes required in CHANGELOG. Breaking changes called out explicitly. |
| **alpha** | Anything goes. Use for experiments and previews. May be removed without deprecation notice. |

## Available Now

These capabilities are shipped and available in the current release.

## In Progress

These features are actively being built and will land in upcoming releases.

**Project Management**
- GenAI project flavor support
- Team ownership via OSS ownership model (CODEOWNERS)

**Pipeline Authoring**
- Draft-based authoring workflow
- Dev/Prod environment labels derived from git branch

**Model Deployment**
- Automatic rollback on alert firing
- Decommission workflow with no-traffic validation gate
- DeploymentEvent tracking

**Generative AI & LLM**
- GenAI service deployment: first-class support for deploying and managing LLM-backed inference endpoints

**Evaluation & Reporting**
- Experiment reports

**Alerting & Monitoring**
- Alert-triggered auto rollback
- Dashboard management via OSS Grafana operator
- Prometheus-based alerting for decommission gating

**Infrastructure**
- Notebook (Jupyter) sessions
- Docker image builds via Kaniko/BuildKit

**Automation**
- Finalizer-based cascade deletion (Pipeline → Revisions; FeatureGroup → Datasets)

## On the Radar

These are planned capabilities we are working towards adding down the road.

**Project Management**
- Cloud zone annotations for multi-cloud routing
- Git repository migration allowlist
- Routing affinity inheritance (parent-to-child annotation propagation)

**Pipeline Authoring & Execution**
- Concurrent update protection via optimistic locking
- Canvas release version validation
- Block dev-branch runs in production (safety gate enforcement)

**Distributed Training**
- GPU SKU normalization and validation via ConfigMap
- mTLS injection via cert-manager or OSS SPIFFE
- Prometheus ConfigMap auto-creation per job
- Job immutability (15-minute lock after kill)
- Spark obsolescence enforcement (7-day auto-kill for runaway jobs)
- Resource usage metrics emission

**Model Deployment**
- Lockdown self-healing: detect and auto-remediate cluster lockdown conditions
- Traffic routing via Istio/Envoy OSS gateway
- Compute lockdown detection
- Global endpoint name uniqueness (cross-namespace validation)

**Feature Store**
- Feature and feature group management
- Online feature store (low-latency feature serving)
- Offline feature datasets
- Feature serving groups
- Feature monitor with drift detection (Wasserstein, KL-divergence, PSI, LOF)
- Feature quality metrics
- Lineage event tracking on create/delete via OpenLineage
- Cascading deletion (FeatureGroup → Dataset)

**Generative AI & LLM**
- AI agent management with declarative agent definitions and LLM registry
- Prompt template management
- Guardrail policies (input/output safety filtering, bias detection)

**Evaluation & Reporting**
- Structured evaluation reports
- Model cards

**Alerting & Monitoring**
- Alert CRD management
- Default cron schedules by alert type

**Infrastructure & Compute**
- Vector dataset management for embedding and RAG/similarity search

**Automation & Self-Healing**
- Lockdown self-healing: detect and auto-remediate cluster lockdown conditions

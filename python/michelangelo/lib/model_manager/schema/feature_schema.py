    schema before packaging (see lib/shared/utils/model_metadata).

        input_schema: The features provided directly by the caller.
        feature_store_features_schema: Additional features looked up from a
            feature store based on the input schema.
        derived_features_schema: Features computed from the input and
            feature-store features (e.g. via transforms), rather than
            supplied or looked up directly.

class TrainingObserver(Protocol):
    """Protocol for observing training events.

    Implement this protocol to receive notifications when training completes
    or checkpoints are saved.

    **Picklability:** Implementations must be picklable when using per-epoch
    observation (``on_checkpoint_saved``), because Ray serializes the training
    config — including the observer — to worker processes. Avoid storing
    non-picklable objects (open file handles, DB connections, lambdas) as
    instance attributes.

    **Worker-side behavior:** ``on_checkpoint_saved`` is called on **every**
    Ray worker (all ranks), not just rank 0. Implementations should be
    idempotent or guard on rank internally if side effects (DB writes,
    HTTP calls) should only happen once.

    Example::

        from michelangelo.lib.trainer.torch.pytorch_lightning import (
            LightningTrainer,
            LightningTrainerParam,
            TrainingObserver,

@runtime_checkable
class ExperimentStore(Protocol):
    """Pluggable locator for resumable Ray Train experiments.

    An ``ExperimentStore`` lets :class:`LightningTrainer` auto-resume a prior
    run's experiment directory. It bridges two moments that live in different
    processes:

    * :meth:`track` runs **on the worker (rank 0 only)** at the start of a run,
      recording where this run's Ray Train experiment directory lives so a
      *future* run can find it.
    * :meth:`locate_resumable` runs **on the driver** before ``fit()``, looking
      up a candidate experiment directory to restore from.

    The stable cross-run identity is ``(storage_path, run_name)`` — both taken
    from the driver's ``RunConfig`` and passed verbatim to both methods, so the
    two sides always agree on the key regardless of how Ray names the on-disk
    experiment directory.

    **Picklability:** implementations must be picklable — Ray serializes the
    training config (including this store) to worker processes for
    :meth:`track`. Avoid open file handles, DB connections, or lambdas as
    instance attributes (same constraint as :class:`TrainingObserver`).

    **Never raise:** neither method may raise on the "nothing to resume" or
    "couldn't persist" paths. :meth:`locate_resumable` returns ``None`` when
    there is nothing to resume; :meth:`track` is best-effort (a failed write
    must not fail an otherwise-successful training run). The trainer additionally
    guards both call sites, so a misbehaving custom store cannot crash training.

    Example (default fsspec backend)::

        from michelangelo.lib.trainer.torch.pytorch_lightning import (
            FsspecExperimentStore,
            LightningTrainerParam,
        )

        param = LightningTrainerParam(
            create_model_fn=my_model_factory,
            create_model_fn_kwargs={},
            train_data=train_ds,
            val_data=val_ds,
            experiment_store=FsspecExperimentStore(),
        )

    Example (bring your own backend)::

        class RedisExperimentStore:
            \"\"\"Record the resume pointer in Redis instead of a marker file.\"\"\"

            def __init__(self, client) -> None:

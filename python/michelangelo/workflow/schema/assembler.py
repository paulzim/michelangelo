"""Typed configuration dataclasses for the tabular assembler task.

Each dataclass configures one framework-specific assembler path (custom
Python-backend or PyTorch/Lightning) or, for ``TabularAssemblerConfig``,
selects between them. Plain dataclasses (rather than a pydantic/ORM model)
keep validation, serialisation, and inspection by the workflow engine simple
and dependency-free at pipeline-definition time.

Consumers may subclass these to add provider-specific fields (e.g. a custom
storage toggle) without modifying this module.

class CustomAssemblerConfig:
    """Configuration for the custom (Python-backend) assembler path.

    Attributes:
        custom_batch_processing: When ``True``, the model implementation
            handles batching itself and receives inputs with an extra leading
            batch dimension on top of the model schema (schema shape
            ``[n, ..., m]`` becomes ``[batch, n, ..., m]``). When
            ``None``/``False``, Triton batches automatically and the model
            sees schema-shaped inputs.
        additional_import_prefixes: Extra Python module prefixes whose source
            files are bundled into the package. Useful when the model class
            uses dynamic imports (e.g. ``importlib``) that static analysis
            misses. Each prefix is resolved recursively.
        include_import_prefixes: Module prefixes the packager's static import
            analysis is restricted to when deciding which of the model
            class's imported modules to bundle. When ``None`` (the default),
            every reachable imported module is considered, which is
            unbounded and can be extremely slow in environments with a very
            large importable module graph (e.g. a monorepo where the model
            class's own package pulls in thousands of transitively-importable
            modules) — set this to scope the walk to the module prefixes that
            actually matter for the model (e.g. ``["mypkg.models"]`` if the
            model class and its real dependencies all live under that one
            package).

            ``None`` selects the packager default (TorchScript/PyTorch).

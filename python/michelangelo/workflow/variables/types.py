@dataclass
class ModelArtifact:
    """A packaged model artifact ready for upload.

    Both the raw model package and the serving-ready deployable artifact are
    represented as ``ModelArtifact`` instances. Packaging must be complete
    before passing to the pusher — packaging is an assembler-time concern
    (e.g. a Ray worker with GPU access).

    Attributes:
        path: Absolute local filesystem path to the packaged artifact file or
            directory.
        metadata: Typed metadata forwarded to the model registry at
            registration time. Subclass ``ModelMetadata`` to add
            provider-specific fields.

    Example:
        >>> from michelangelo.workflow.variables.metadata import ModelMetadata
        >>> meta = ModelMetadata(training_framework="xgboost", deployable=True)
        >>> artifact = ModelArtifact(path="/tmp/model", metadata=meta)

    """A trained model transmitted between workflow tasks.

    Both artifacts must be fully packaged before passing to the pusher.
    Packaging is the assembler's responsibility. The pusher only uploads and
    registers pre-packaged artifacts.

    Attributes:
        raw_model: Raw model package (weights + sample data) intended for
            offline validation and reproducibility.
        deployable_model: Serving-ready bundle (e.g. Triton config + weights)
            intended for deployment to a model server.

    Example:
        >>> artifact = ModelArtifact(path="/tmp/model.ubj")
        >>> assembled = AssembledModel(
        ...     raw_model=artifact,

    Attributes:

        plugin: Plugin name that was invoked (e.g. ``"model_plugin"``).
        success: ``True`` if the plugin completed without error.
        value: Plugin-specific return data. Empty dict when ``success`` is
            ``False``.
        error: Human-readable error description when ``success`` is ``False``.
            ``None`` when ``success`` is ``True``.

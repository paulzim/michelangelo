## tools/ (Development Scripts)

Scripts in the root `tools/` directory are for **development purposes** and may be used in CI/CD pipelines or by developers during regular development workflows.

### Development Scripts:

- **`bazel` / `bazelisk.py`** - Bazel build tool wrapper
- **`gazelle`** - Go BUILD file generator
- **`go`** - Go toolchain wrapper
- **`goimports`** - Go import formatter

These scripts are:
- Part of the standard development workflow
- May be referenced in CI/CD configurations
- Should be committed to the repository
- Used by all developers

## tools/test/ (Local Testing Only)

Scripts in `tools/test/` are for **local testing purposes only** and should **NOT** be used in production or committed as part of production code.

### Testing Scripts:

- **`generate-certs.sh`** - Generate TLS certificates for local webhook testing
  - Generates self-signed CA and TLS certificates
  - Used for testing CRD conversion webhooks locally
  - Certificates are for development/testing only, NOT for production

These scripts are:

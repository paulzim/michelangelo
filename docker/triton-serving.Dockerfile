# Michelangelo's default Triton serving image.
#
# The stock nvcr.io/nvidia/tritonserver image's python backend has no ML
# framework deps installed, so any custom python-backend model (produced by
# CustomTritonPackager) that imports torch/transformers at load time fails
# with ModuleNotFoundError. This adds those on top of the stock image so it
# works as the default serving image for Triton-backed InferenceServers --
# see go/components/inferenceserver/backends/triton.go's tritonImage().
#
# torch==2.4.1/transformers==4.44.2 were originally pinned because the prior
# 23.04 base shipped Python 3.8, which capped what was installable. 25.01
# ships Python 3.12, so that cap no longer applies -- these pins are no
# longer forced, just not yet revisited.
#
# Pinned to 25.01 specifically (not a newer release) because that's the
# version already running in production internally, via Uber's own
# ml_gpu_base vendoring -- not the latest available, but the one with actual
# production track record behind it.
#
# A model needing deps/versions outside this image can still override it via
# InferenceServer.spec.initSpec.servingSpec.containerBuildTemplate.

/**
 * Reshapes the run being retried into the payload that creates its replacement.
 *
 * Retry here is resume-shaped rather than a reset: instead of rewinding the original
 * workflow in place (what `spec.retryInfo` and the per-step Retry button do), it starts a
 * fresh run whose `spec.resume` points back at this one. Every task that already
 * succeeded is then served from cache, so execution effectively picks up at the first
 * task that did not.
 *
 * Order matters — operations are applied in sequence against the same record, so
 * `spec.resume` has to be written from `metadata.name` before that field is replaced with
 * the new run's name.
 *
 * Copies need an identity `transformation`: `applyMiddleware` only writes when a
 * transformation function is present, or when the source is nil and a `default` is set.

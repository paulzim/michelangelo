/**
 * Represents the different phases in the Michelangelo Studio workflow.
 * Each phase corresponds to a specific stage in the machine learning lifecycle.
 *
 * These phases serve two important purposes:
 * 1. They are used in URLs to navigate between different sections of the application
 * 2. They define the initial grouping of the application's schema and data structure
 *
 * The string values of these enums are used directly in URLs (e.g., /monitor, /train),
 * so they should be kept URL-friendly and consistent.
 *
 * The phases are naturally grouped into three categories:
 * - Phases that are distinct from any workflow, e.g., Project and Assistants
 *
 * - Traditional ML workflow: Data → Train → Retrain → Deploy → Monitor
 *
 * - Generative AI workflow: LLM → Data → Prompt → Finetune → Monitor
 *
 * - Agent workflow: Data → Develop → Deploy → Monitor
